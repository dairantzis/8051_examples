The 2V3 packet based protocol is used in most of my MCU projects to communicate data to/from the MCU.
Each packet consists of:
1. a header: byte 0x02
2. a byte holding the length of the packet payload:
     Payload length does not include the overhead bytes
     of head, length, sum and tail.
3. a byte holding the sum of the packet payload
4. a tail: byte 0x03

The payload can carry any bytes, not just text.
The significance of the payload contents depends on the application.
